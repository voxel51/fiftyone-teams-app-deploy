## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- License file from Voxel51
- Docker Hub credentials from Voxel51
- MongoDB instance available. 
  - FiftyOne Teams is compatible with MongoDB Community, Enterprise, or Atlas Editions.
  - If using MongoDB Community or Enterprise we recommend a minimum of 4vCPU and 16GB of RAM. Large datasets and 
  complex samples may require additional resources.
  - If using Atlas we recommend starting on at least a M40 cluster tier - you can then use utilization metrics to 
  make scaling decisions (up or down). Please note that we do not   support MongoDB Atlas Serverless instances 
  because we require Aggregations.


## Step 1: Prepare License File

> Required for **v2.0+**

1. Set `LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR` in your `.env`
2. Place the license file there and rename it to `license`

```bash
. .env
mkdir -p "${LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR}"
mv license.key "${LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR}/license"
```

> [!TIP]
> When rotating the license, to ensure that the new license values are
> picked up immediately, you may need to restart the `teams-cas` and
> `teams-api` services.

## Step 2: Choose Authentication Mode

FiftyOne Enterprise offers two authentication modes:

- `legacy-auth` ‚Üí Choose this mode if using Auth0 for user authentication and authorization.
- `internal-auth` ‚Üí Choose this mode when in an airgapped deployment - aigapped deployments 
will not require network egress to external services.

### üëâ Choose your mode

Navigate into the appropriate directory:

```bash
cd legacy-auth       # or internal-auth
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment

### 1. Copy the template `.env` file:

```
cp env.template .env
```

### 2. Fill out required values in `.env`

At minimum, configure:

- `BASE_URL` / `AUTH0_BASE_URL` - Your WebApp URL
- `FIFTYONE_API_URI` - Your API URL (can be the same as webApp URL if using path-based routing)
- `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_URI` ‚Äì Your MongoDB connection URI
- `FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` ‚Äì Used to encrypt storage credentials

> üîë To generate a key:

```
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())
```

- `LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR` ‚Äì Path where the license is mounted
- `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET` ‚Äì Shared secret for CAS and App auth
- Any other variables noted in the `.env.template` or listed in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section

### 3. Create a `compose.override.yaml` to override configuration.

```
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN: true  # Only for first install
```

### üì¶ Official Docker Images

Voxel51 publishes the following private FiftyOne Enterprise images to Docker Hub:

- `voxel51/fiftyone-app`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-app-gpt`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-app-torch` ‚Üê for text similarity / PyTorch support
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-api`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-cas`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-cv-full` ‚Üê full CV/ML environment

> üîê For access, contact your Voxel51 support team to obtain Docker Hub credentials.

You can override the default image used by any service in `compose.override.yaml`. For example:

```
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    image: voxel51/fiftyone-app-torch:v2.10.0
```

## Step 4: Initial Deployment

### 1. Enable Database Admin mode

In `compose.override.yaml`, make sure:

```
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN: true
```

> This allows the application to create and migrate the database schema.

### 2. Launch the application

In the same directory:

```
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the following containers:

- `fiftyone-teams-app` (UI) ‚Üí default port `3000`
- `fiftyone-teams-api` (API) ‚Üí default port `8000`
- `fiftyone-teams-cas` (Auth) ‚Üí default port `3030`


You can ensure that all your containers are up and healthy through:

```
docker compose ps
```

For HTTP-based health checks, run the following `curl` commands:

```
curl -Iv http://localhost:3030/cas/api
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

curl -Iv http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

curl -Iv http://localhost:3000/api/hello
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## Step 5: Configure SSL & Reverse Proxy (Nginx / Load Balancer)

Next, you will need to place a **reverse proxy or SSL endpoint** in front of your FiftyOne 
Enterprise services. This can be a tool like:

- **Nginx**
- **HAProxy**
- **Cloud Load Balancer** (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer)

These proxies will:

- Route traffic to the correct services (`teams-app`, `teams-api`, `teams-cas`)
- Terminate HTTPS/SSL (if using TLS)
- Optionally apply authentication headers, logging, or load balancing

### üß≠ Routing Overview (Path-Based Proxy)

| Path              | Proxied To       | Description                          |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/`               | `teams-app`      | Main web UI                          |
| `/cas`            | `teams-cas`      | Central Authentication Service (CAS) |
| `/graphql/v1`     | `teams-api`      | GraphQL API endpoint                 |
| `/file`           | `teams-api`      | File import handling                 |
| `/_pymongo`       | `teams-api`      | MongoDB requests via SDK             |
| `/health`         | `teams-api`      | Health check endpoint                |

### üìÅ Nginx Configuration Options

Voxel51 provides example Nginx configs for two routing strategies:

#### üîπ 1. **Path-Based Routing**
All services are routed based on URL path:

üìÑ Full configuration here: [`example-nginx-path-routing.conf`](./example-nginx-path-routing.conf)

#### üîπ 2. **Hostname-Based Routing**
teams-app and teams-api are routed using different subdomain or hostname:

- `fiftyone.your-company.com` ‚Üí App
- `fiftyone-api.your-company.com` ‚Üí API

üìÑ Full configuration here:
- [`example-nginx-site.conf`](./example-nginx-site.conf) (App + CAS)
- [`example-nginx-api.conf`](./example-nginx-api.conf) (API)


### üìå Notes

- FiftyOne Enterprise supports routing traffic through proxy servers. Please refer to the 
[proxy configuration documentation](./docs/configuring-proxies.md) for information on how to configure proxies.
- To validate your deployments api connection, see [Validating Your Deployment](../docs/validating-deployment.md)


## Step 6: Configuring FiftyOne Enterprise Plugins

FiftyOne Enterprise supports three plugin modes: **Builtin**, **Shared**, and **Dedicated**. Each offers different 
trade-offs in isolation, flexibility, and resource management.

### üîπ 1. Builtin Plugins Only (Default)

This is the default configuration. It enables only the plugins shipped with the platform.

‚úÖ No additional configuration needed.

### üîπ 2. Shared Plugins (Custom Plugins in `fiftyone-app`)

Custom plugins are run **within the same container** as the app (`fiftyone-app`). Use this if:

- You want to quickly prototype plugins
- You‚Äôre okay with shared resource usage between app and plugins

#### Enable shared plugin mode:

1. Use `compose.plugins.yaml` (instead of `compose.yaml`)
2. This mounts a shared volume for plugins across services

```
docker compose \
  -f compose.plugins.yaml \
  -f compose.override.yaml \
  up -d
```

> üìÅ Plugins will run inside the `fiftyone-app` container.

### üîπ 3. RECOMMENDED: Dedicated Plugins (Isolated `teams-plugins` Service)

Custom plugins are run in a **separate `teams-plugins` container**, isolated from the app and API services.

Use this mode when:

- You want full isolation and stability
- You are running many or complex plugins
- You need to manage plugin memory or compute separately

#### Enable dedicated plugin mode:

1. Ensure your `.env` file includes the following:

```
FIFTYONE_TEAMS_PLUGIN_URL=http://teams-plugins:5151
```

2. Use `compose.dedicated-plugins.yaml` (instead of `compose.yaml`)

```
docker compose \
  -f compose.dedicated-plugins.yaml \
  -f compose.override.yaml \
  up -d
```

3. Optional: If using a [proxy server](./docs/configuring-proxies.md), ensure the plugin service is excluded from proxying.

> üîß This prevents traffic from being routed incorrectly through your proxy for internal plugin calls.

### üìå Notes

- All plugin modes require persistent storage (volumes) for plugin files.
- For multi-node deployments, ensure that the volume is available on all nodes.
- To manage and deploy plugins via the UI, go to:  
  `https://<your-domain>/settings/plugins`

## Step 7: Configuring FiftyOne Enterprise Delegated Operators

Delegated Operators allow FiftyOne Enterprise to offload plugin execution to **worker containers**, enabling 
scalable and reliable long-running operations.

üß© This feature is **compatible with all three plugin modes**: Builtin, Shared, and Dedicated.

### üîß Enabling Delegated Operator Mode

To launch worker containers, include `compose.delegated-operators.yaml` alongside your existing plugin mode.

#### Example: Enable on top of **Dedicated Plugins** mode

```
docker compose \
  -f compose.dedicated-plugins.yaml \
  -f compose.delegated-operators.yaml \
  -f compose.override.yaml \
  up -d
```

> üìÅ This will start a `teams-delegated-operator` service and attach it to the shared plugin volume.

### üìÑ Optional: Upload Run Logs

You can enable **log uploads** for delegated operation runs by setting:

```
FIFTYONE_DELEGATED_OPERATION_LOG_PATH=/mnt/shared/logs
```

Logs will be stored in the format:

```
/mnt/shared/logs/do_logs/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<RUN_ID>.log
```

This is useful for auditing, debugging, or monitoring delegated operator executions in shared storage or cloud buckets.

### üñ•Ô∏è GPU-Enabled Workloads

FiftyOne services like Delegated Operators can be scheduled on **GPU-enabled hardware** for more efficient computation.

To setup containers with GPU resources, see the  
[configuring GPU workloads documentation](./docs/configuring-gpu-workloads.md).

### üß± Custom Plugin Images

If your delegated operators or plugins require **custom dependencies**, build and deploy **custom plugin images**. 
You can base them on `voxel51/fiftyone-app`, and include:

- Custom Python packages
- ML libraries (e.g. PyTorch, OpenCV)
- Internal SDKs or models


## Step 8: Configuring Authentication (CAS)


FiftyOne Enterprise uses a Central Authentication Service (CAS) introduced in v1.6. This enables centralized 
login, roles, and user management.

### üõ†Ô∏è Optional: CAS Customization Instructions

1. Update required CAS variables in `.env`:
   - `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET`
   - `CAS_BASE_URL`
   - `CAS_BIND_ADDRESS`
   - `CAS_BIND_PORT`
   - `CAS_DATABASE_NAME` (‚ö†Ô∏è Must be unique per deployment)
   - `CAS_DEBUG`
   - `CAS_DEFAULT_USER_ROLE`
1. Update `compose.override.yaml` with any needed `teams-cas` service changes.
1. Use `docker compose` from within the `legacy-auth`/`internal-auth` directory to bring up services.
1. Ensure your proxy (e.g., nginx) forwards `/cas` to the CAS service port.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- [Pluggable authentication docs](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/pluggable_auth.html#pluggable-authentication) 
includes information on configuring CAS.
- To set up authentication for internal-auth mode: Refer to the 
[Getting Started with Internal Mode documentation](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/pluggable_auth.html#getting-started-with-internal-mode).


## Upgrades

When upgrading FiftyOne Enterprise, you must explicitly **prevent automatic database migrations** 
to avoid breaking active SDK sessions or deployments.

### üö´ Disable Automatic Migrations

Before running your upgraded containers, set the following override:

"code"
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN: false
"code"

> This ensures that **no automatic migrations** will occur when the container starts.

The environment variable `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN` acts as a safeguard to prevent the database from being modified automatically.

### üõ†Ô∏è What Happens If You Migrate with database admin False?

If `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN=false` is set, and a migration attempt is made via CLI:

```shell
$ fiftyone migrate --all
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OSError: Cannot migrate database from v0.22.0 to v0.22.3 when database_admin=False.
```

or no action will be taken:

```shell
$ fiftyone migrate --info
FiftyOne Enterprise version: 0.14.4

FiftyOne compatibility version: 0.22.3
Other compatible versions: >=0.19,<0.23

Database version: 0.21.2

dataset     version
----------  ---------
quickstart  0.22.0
$ fiftyone migrate --all
$ fiftyone migrate --info
FiftyOne Enterprise version: 0.14.4

FiftyOne compatibility version: 0.23.0
Other compatible versions: >=0.19,<0.23

Database version: 0.21.2

dataset     version
----------  ---------
quickstart  0.21.2
```

### üìö Next Steps

After disabling `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN`, refer to:

[Upgrading](./docs/upgrading.md)

for complete guidance on upgrading from previous versions

## Known Issues

For a list of common issues and their solutions, refer to the  
[üìÑ Known Issues documentation](./docs/known-issues.md).

If you encounter a new issue, please open a ticket on the  
[üì¨ GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app-deploy/issues).


## Advanced Configuration

### Snapshot Archival

Since version v1.5, FiftyOne Enterprise supports
[archiving snapshots](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/dataset_versioning.html#snapshot-archival)
to cold storage locations to prevent filling up the MongoDB database.
Supported locations are network mounted filesystems and cloud storage folders.

Please refer to the
[snapshot archival configuration documentation](./docs/configuring-snapshot-archival.md)
for configuring snapshot archival.

### Static Banner Configuration

FiftyOne Enterprise v2.6 introduces the ability to add a static banner to the
application.

Banner text is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT`.

Banner background color is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_COLOR`.

Banner text color is configured with:
`casSettings.env.FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR` and
`teamsAppSettings.env.FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR`

Examples:

```yaml
services:
  teams-app-common:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT: "Internal Deployment"
  teams-cas-common:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT: "Internal Deployment"
```

### Terms of Service, Privacy, and Imprint URLs

FiftyOne Enterprise v2.6 introduces the ability to override
the Terms of Service, Privacy, and Imprint (optional) links
if required in the App.

Configure the URLs by setting the following environment variables in
your `compose.override.yaml`.

Terms of Service URL is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_TERMS_URL`.

Privacy URL is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_PRIVACY_URL`.

Imprint/Impressum URL is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_IMPRINT_URL`

Examples:

```yaml
services:
  teams-app-common:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_APP_TERMS_URL: https://abc.com/tos
      FIFTYONE_APP_PRIVACY_URL: https://abc.com/privacy
      FIFTYONE_APP_IMPRINT_URL: https://abc.com/imprint
```
