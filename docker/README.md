## :green_book: Prerequisites Skills and Knowledge

The following prerequisites skills & knowledge
are required for a successful and properly secured
deployment of FiftyOne Enterprise.

A knowledge of:

1. Docker compose.

1. MongoDB.

1. DNS and the ability to generate, modify, and delete DNS records.

1. TLS/SSL and the ability to generate TLS/SSL certificates.

## :white_check_mark: Technical Requirements

1. [Docker][docker-install]
   and
   [Docker Compose][docker-compose-install]
   installed.

1. License file from Voxel51.

1. [Docker Hub][docker-hub]
   credentials from Voxel51.

1. A MongoDB Database that meets FiftyOne's
  [version constraints](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/config.html#using-a-different-mongodb-version).

1. A DNS record or records for ingress.

1. A TLS/SSL certificate or certificates for HTTPS ingress.

## :clock10: Estimated Completion Time

The estimated time to deploy FiftyOne Enterprise is approximately 2 hours.

## :floppy_disk: Sizing

Voxel51 recommends the following resource sizing:

- MongoDB: 4 CPU, 16GB RAM, 256GB Storage
- Docker Compose Server: 8 CPU, 32GB RAM, 256GB Storage

Voxel51 also recommends monitoring resource consumption across
the applications.
Resource usage varies dramatically with operations, use cases,
and dataset sizes.

## :closed_lock_with_key: Step 1: Prepare License File

> Required for **v2.0+**

1. Set `LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR` in your `.env`
2. Place the license file there and rename it to `license`

```bash
. .env
mkdir -p "${LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR}"
mv license.key "${LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR}/license"
```

> [!TIP] When rotating the license, to ensure that the new license values are
> picked up immediately, you may need to restart the `teams-cas` and `teams-api`
> services.

## :file_folder: Step 2: Choose Authentication Mode

FiftyOne Enterprise offers two authentication modes:

- `legacy-auth` → Choose this mode if using Auth0 for user authentication and
  authorization.
- `internal-auth` → Choose this mode when in an airgapped deployment - aigapped
  deployments will not require network egress to external services.

### :point_right: Choose your mode

Navigate into the appropriate directory:

```bash
cd legacy-auth       # or internal-auth
```

## :gear: Step 3: Configure Environment

### 1. Copy the template `.env` file

```bash
cp env.template .env
```

### 2. Fill out required values in `.env`

At minimum, configure:

- `BASE_URL` / `AUTH0_BASE_URL` - Your WebApp URL
- `FIFTYONE_API_URI` - Your API URL (can be the same as webApp URL if using
  path-based routing)
- `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_URI` – Your MongoDB connection URI
- `FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` – Used to encrypt storage credentials

> :key: To generate a key:

```bash
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())
```

- `LOCAL_LICENSE_FILE_DIR` – Path where the license is mounted
- `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET` – Shared secret for CAS and App auth
- Any other variables noted in the `.env.template` or listed in the
  [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section

### 3. Create a `compose.override.yaml` to override configuration

```yaml
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN: true # Only for first install
```

### :package: Official Docker Images

Voxel51 publishes the following private FiftyOne Enterprise images to Docker
Hub:

- `voxel51/fiftyone-app`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-app-gpt`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-app-torch` ← for text similarity / PyTorch support
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-api`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-cas`
- `voxel51/fiftyone-teams-cv-full` ← full CV/ML environment

> :closed_lock_with_key: For access, contact your Voxel51 support team to obtain
> Docker Hub credentials.

You can override the default image used by any service in
`compose.override.yaml`. For example:

```yaml
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    image: voxel51/fiftyone-app-torch:v2.12.0
```

## :rocket: Step 4: Initial Deployment

### 1. Enable Database Admin mode

In `compose.override.yaml`, make sure:

```yaml
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN: true
```

> This allows the application to create and migrate the database schema.

### 2. Launch the application

In the same directory:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the following containers:

- `fiftyone-teams-app` (UI) → default port `3000`
- `fiftyone-teams-api` (API) → default port `8000`
- `fiftyone-teams-cas` (Auth) → default port `3030`

You can ensure that all your containers are up and healthy through:

```shell
docker compose ps
```

For HTTP-based health checks, run the following `curl` commands:

```shell
curl -Iv http://localhost:3030/cas/api
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

curl -Iv http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

curl -Iv http://localhost:3000/api/hello
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## :globe_with_meridians: Step 5: Configure SSL & Reverse Proxy (Nginx / Load Balancer)

Next, you will need to place a **reverse proxy or SSL endpoint** in front of
your FiftyOne Enterprise services. This can be a tool like:

- **Nginx**
- **HAProxy**
- **Cloud Load Balancer** (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer)

These proxies will:

- Route traffic to the correct services (`teams-app`, `teams-api`, `teams-cas`)
- Terminate HTTPS/SSL (if using TLS)
- Optionally apply authentication headers, logging, or load balancing

### :compass: Routing Overview (Path-Based Proxy)

| Path          | Proxied To  | Description                          |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/`           | `teams-app` | Main web UI                          |
| `/cas`        | `teams-cas` | Central Authentication Service (CAS) |
| `/graphql/v1` | `teams-api` | GraphQL API endpoint                 |
| `/file`       | `teams-api` | File import handling                 |
| `/_pymongo`   | `teams-api` | MongoDB requests via SDK             |
| `/health`     | `teams-api` | Health check endpoint                |

### :open_file_folder: Nginx Configuration Options

Voxel51 provides example Nginx configs for two routing strategies:

#### :small_blue_diamond: 1. **Path-Based Routing**

All services are routed based on URL path:

:page_facing_up: Full configuration here:
[`example-nginx-path-routing.conf`](./example-nginx-path-routing.conf)

#### :small_blue_diamond: 2. **Hostname-Based Routing**

teams-app and teams-api are routed using different subdomain or hostname:

- `fiftyone.your-company.com` → App
- `fiftyone-api.your-company.com` → API

:page_facing_up: Full configuration here:

- [`example-nginx-site.conf`](./example-nginx-site.conf) (App + CAS)
- [`example-nginx-api.conf`](./example-nginx-api.conf) (API)

### :memo: Notes

- FiftyOne Enterprise supports routing traffic through proxy servers. Please
  refer to the
  [proxy configuration documentation](./docs/configuring-proxies.md) for
  information on how to configure proxies.
- To validate your deployments api connection, see
  [Validating Your Deployment](../docs/validating-deployment.md)

## :jigsaw: Step 6: Configuring FiftyOne Enterprise Plugins

FiftyOne Enterprise supports three plugin modes: **Builtin**, **Shared**, and
**Dedicated**. Each offers different trade-offs in isolation, flexibility, and
resource management.

### :small_blue_diamond: 1. Builtin Plugins Only (Default)

This is the default configuration. It enables only the plugins shipped with the
platform.

:white_check_mark: No additional configuration needed.

### :small_blue_diamond: 2. Shared Plugins

Custom plugins are run **within the same container** as the app
(`fiftyone-app`). Use this if:

- You want to quickly prototype plugins
- You’re okay with shared resource usage between app and plugins

#### Enable shared plugin mode

1. Use `compose.plugins.yaml` (instead of `compose.yaml`)
2. This mounts a shared volume for plugins across services

```shell
docker compose \
  -f compose.plugins.yaml \
  -f compose.override.yaml \
  up -d
```

> 📁 Plugins will run inside the `fiftyone-app` container.

### :small_blue_diamond: 3. RECOMMENDED: Dedicated Plugins

Custom plugins are run in a **separate `teams-plugins` container**, isolated
from the app and API services.

Use this mode when:

- You want full isolation and stability
- You are running many or complex plugins
- You need to manage plugin memory or compute separately

#### Enable dedicated plugin mode

1. Ensure your `.env` file includes the following:

```shell
FIFTYONE_TEAMS_PLUGIN_URL=http://teams-plugins:5151
```

1. Use `compose.dedicated-plugins.yaml` (instead of `compose.yaml`)

```shell
docker compose \
  -f compose.dedicated-plugins.yaml \
  -f compose.override.yaml \
  up -d
```

1. Optional: If using a [proxy server](./docs/configuring-proxies.md), ensure
   the plugin service is excluded from proxying.

> 🔧 This prevents traffic from being routed incorrectly through your proxy for
> internal plugin calls.

### :pushpin: Notes

- All plugin modes require persistent storage (volumes) for plugin files.
- For multi-node deployments, ensure that the volume is available on all nodes.
- To manage and deploy plugins via the UI, go to:
  `https://<your-domain>/settings/plugins`

## :gear: Step 7: Configuring FiftyOne Enterprise Delegated Operators

Delegated Operators allow FiftyOne Enterprise to offload plugin execution to
**worker containers**, enabling scalable and reliable long-running operations.

:jigsaw: This feature is **compatible with all three plugin modes**: Builtin,
Shared, and Dedicated.

### :wrench: Enabling Delegated Operator Mode

To launch worker containers, include `compose.delegated-operators.yaml`
alongside your existing plugin mode.

#### Example: Enable on top of **Dedicated Plugins** mode

```shell
docker compose \
  -f compose.dedicated-plugins.yaml \
  -f compose.delegated-operators.yaml \
  -f compose.override.yaml \
  up -d
```

> :open_file_folder: This will start a `teams-delegated-operator` service and
> attach it to the shared plugin volume.

### :page_facing_up: Optional: Upload Run Logs

You can enable **log uploads** for delegated operation runs by setting:

```shell
FIFTYONE_DELEGATED_OPERATION_LOG_PATH=/mnt/shared/logs
```

Logs will be stored in the format:

```shell
/mnt/shared/logs/do_logs/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<RUN_ID>.log
```

This is useful for auditing, debugging, or monitoring delegated operator
executions in shared storage or cloud buckets.

### :desktop_computer: GPU-Enabled Workloads

FiftyOne services like Delegated Operators can be scheduled on **GPU-enabled
hardware** for more efficient computation.

To setup containers with GPU resources, see the
[configuring GPU workloads documentation](./docs/configuring-gpu-workloads.md).

### :bricks: Custom Plugin Images

If your delegated operators or plugins require **custom dependencies**, build
and deploy **custom plugin images**. You can base them on
`voxel51/fiftyone-app`, and include:

- Custom Python packages
- ML libraries (e.g. PyTorch, OpenCV)
- Internal SDKs or models

### :on: On-Demand Delegated Operator Executors

FiftyOne Enterprise v2.11 introduces support for on-demand delegated operator
executors for Databricks and Anyscale. Please refer to the
[configuration documentation](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app-deploy/blob/main/docs/configuring-on-demand-orchestrator.md).

## Step 8: Identity Provider (IdP) and Authentication (CAS)

### :information_source: IdP configuration

You can refer to the following docs to set up your Identity Provider with
FiftyOne.

- [Pluggable authentication docs](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/pluggable_auth.html#pluggable-authentication)
  includes information on configuring CAS.
- To set up authentication for internal-auth mode: Refer to the
  [Getting Started with Internal Mode documentation](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/pluggable_auth.html#getting-started-with-internal-mode).

FiftyOne Enterprise uses a Central Authentication Service (CAS) introduced in
v1.6. This enables centralized login, roles, and user management.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Optional: CAS Customization Instructions

1. Update required CAS variables in `.env`:
   - `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET`
   - `CAS_BASE_URL`
   - `CAS_BIND_ADDRESS`
   - `CAS_BIND_PORT`
   - `CAS_DATABASE_NAME` (⚠️ Must be unique per deployment)
   - `CAS_DEBUG`
   - `CAS_DEFAULT_USER_ROLE`
1. Update `compose.override.yaml` with any needed `teams-cas` service changes.
1. Use `docker compose` from within the `legacy-auth`/`internal-auth` directory
   to bring up services.
1. Ensure your proxy (e.g., nginx) forwards `/cas` to the CAS service port.

## Upgrades

When upgrading FiftyOne Enterprise, you must explicitly **prevent automatic
database migrations** to avoid breaking active SDK sessions or deployments.

### :no_entry_sign: Disable Automatic Migrations

Before running your upgraded containers, set the following override:

```yaml
services:
  fiftyone-app:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN: false
```

> This ensures that **no automatic migrations** will occur when the container
> starts.

The environment variable `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN` acts as a safeguard to
prevent the database from being modified automatically.

### :hammer_and_wrench: What Happens If You Migrate with database admin False?

If `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN=false` is set, and a migration attempt is made via
CLI:

```shell
$ fiftyone migrate --all
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OSError: Cannot migrate database from v0.22.0 to v0.22.3 when database_admin=False.
```

or no action will be taken:

```shell
$ fiftyone migrate --info
FiftyOne Enterprise version: 0.14.4

FiftyOne compatibility version: 0.22.3
Other compatible versions: >=0.19,<0.23

Database version: 0.21.2

dataset     version
----------  ---------
quickstart  0.22.0
$ fiftyone migrate --all
$ fiftyone migrate --info
FiftyOne Enterprise version: 0.14.4

FiftyOne compatibility version: 0.23.0
Other compatible versions: >=0.19,<0.23

Database version: 0.21.2

dataset     version
----------  ---------
quickstart  0.21.2
```

### :books: Next Steps

After disabling `FIFTYONE_DATABASE_ADMIN`, refer to:

[Upgrading](./docs/upgrading.md)

for complete guidance on upgrading from previous versions

## Known Issues

For a list of common issues and their solutions, refer to the
[:page_facing_up: Known Issues documentation](./docs/known-issues.md).

If you encounter a new issue, please open a ticket on the
[:mailbox_with_mail: GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app-deploy/issues).

## Advanced Configuration

### Backup And Recovery

FiftyOne Enterprise data is stored in MongoDB.
It is recommended to periodically backup the MongoDB instance
according to
[MongoDB best practices](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools/).

If needed, it is recommended to restore the most-recent backup
according to
[MongoDB best practices](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools/)

### Secrets And Sensitive Data

By default, database credentials, cookie secrets,
encryption keys, and authentication secrets are stored in environment variables.
This is configured by the following settings in `.env`:

```dotenv
# This should be a MongoDB Connection String for your database
FIFTYONE_DATABASE_URI="mongodb://username:password@mongodb-example.fiftyone.ai:27017/?authSource=admin"
# If you are using a different MongoDB Connection String for your CAS database,
#  set it here
# CAS_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://username:password@mongodb-cas-example.fiftyone.ai:27017/?authSource=admin"

# FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET is a random string used to authenticate to the CAS service
# This can be any string you care to use generated by any mechanism you prefer.
# You could use something like:
#  `cat /dev/urandom | LC_CTYPE=C tr -cd '[:graph:]' | head -c 32`
#  to generate this string.
# This is used for inter-service authentication and for the SuperUser to
#  authenticate at the CAS UI to configure the Central Authentication Service.
FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET=

# This key is required and is used to encrypt storage credentials in the MongoDB
#   do NOT lose this key!
# generate keys by executing the following in python:
#
# from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())
#
FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

FIFTYONE_DEFAULT_APP_PORT=5151
```

FiftyOne Enterprise supports
[configuring secrets](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/secrets.html#adding-secrets)
for the deployment to use.

Please see
[Storage Credentials and `FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`](#storage-credentials-and-fiftyone_encryption_key)
and
[adding secrets](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/secrets.html#adding-secrets)
for questions regarding storage and encryption.

### Snapshot Archival

Since version v1.5, FiftyOne Enterprise supports
[archiving snapshots](https://docs.voxel51.com/enterprise/dataset_versioning.html#snapshot-archival)
to cold storage locations to prevent filling up the MongoDB database. Supported
locations are network mounted filesystems and cloud storage folders.

Please refer to the
[snapshot archival configuration documentation](./docs/configuring-snapshot-archival.md)
for configuring snapshot archival.

### Static Banner Configuration

FiftyOne Enterprise v2.6 introduces the ability to add a static banner to the
application.

Banner text is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT`.

Banner background color is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_COLOR`.

Banner text color is configured with:
`casSettings.env.FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR` and
`teamsAppSettings.env.FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR`

Examples:

```yaml
services:
  teams-app-common:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT: "Internal Deployment"
  teams-cas-common:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT_COLOR: `green | rgb(34,139,34") | '#f1f1f1'`
      FIFTYONE_APP_BANNER_TEXT: "Internal Deployment"
```

### Storage Credentials and `FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

Containers based on the `fiftyone-teams-api` and `fiftyone-app`
images must include the `FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable.
This key is used to encrypt storage credentials in the MongoDB database.

To generate a value for `FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, run this
Python code and add the output to your `.env` file.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())
```

Voxel51 does not have access to this encryption key and cannot reproduce it.
Please store this key in a safe place.
If the key is lost, you will need to

1. Schedule an outage window
    1. Drop the storage credentials collection
    1. Replace the encryption key
    1. Add the storage credentials via the UI again.

Users with `Admin` permissions may use the FiftyOne Enterprise UI to manage storage
credentials by navigating to `https://<DEPOY_URL>/settings/cloud_storage_credentials`.

If added via the UI, storage credentials no longer need to be
mounted into containers or provided via environment variables.

FiftyOne Enterprise continues to support the use of environment variables to set
storage credentials in the application context and is providing an alternate
configuration path.

### Terms of Service, Privacy, and Imprint URLs

FiftyOne Enterprise v2.6 introduces the ability to override the Terms of
Service, Privacy, and Imprint (optional) links if required in the App.

Configure the URLs by setting the following environment variables in your
`compose.override.yaml`.

Terms of Service URL is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_TERMS_URL`.

Privacy URL is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_PRIVACY_URL`.

Imprint/Impressum URL is configured with `FIFTYONE_APP_IMPRINT_URL`

Examples:

```yaml
services:
  teams-app-common:
    environment:
      FIFTYONE_APP_TERMS_URL: https://abc.com/tos
      FIFTYONE_APP_PRIVACY_URL: https://abc.com/privacy
      FIFTYONE_APP_IMPRINT_URL: https://abc.com/imprint
```

## Validating

After deploying FiftyOne Enterprise and configuring authentication, please
follow
[validating your deployment](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app-deploy/blob/main/docs/validating-deployment.md).

## Health Checks And Monitoring

### Basic Health Assessment

Containers will report their status in the output of `docker compose ps`:

```shell
docker compose ps --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.Service}}\t{{.RunningFor}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

Note that number of containers and containers names may vary per deployment.

### Troubleshooting Unhealthy Containers

If containers show unhealthy states (e.g., `Restarting`, `Exited`):

1. **Get detailed container information**:

   ```shell
   docker inspect <container-name>
   ```

1. **Check application logs**:

   ```shell
   docker compose logs <service-name>
   ```
