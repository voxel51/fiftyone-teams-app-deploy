# # Voxel51 provided you with a voxel51-docker.json file, you can use the following command to create a Pull Secret:
# #
# # ```shell
# #  kubectl --namespace your-namespace-here create secret generic regcred \
# #    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=./voxel51-docker.json --type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
# # ```
# #
# # If you use the Voxel51 command above your imagePullSecrets would look like:
# imagePullSecrets:
#   - name: regcred
